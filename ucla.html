			TITLE <br> <br>

			<p> In Summer 2012, I participated in the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) High School Summer Research Program. I worked with Aaron Tsai, another high school intern from Southern California; graduate students Enbo Zhu and Lingyan Ruan, our mentors; and Dr. Yu Huang, an associate professor in the Department of Materials Science's <a href="http://www.seas.ucla.edu/huanggroup/index.html" target="_blank" class="folioLink"<a>Functional Nanostructures Laboratory</a>. </p>

			<p> Our research focused on nanotechnology and biomimetics, the study of biological systems as models for designing materials and machines. The Functional Nanostructures Lab is working towards developing an entirely new way of shaping, or characterizing, nanocrystals via biomimetics. My project successfully determined that biomimetics is a viable method of shaping platinum nanowires, a particlar of nanocrystal shape. </p>

			<p> BACKGROUND. Platinum nanocrystals are used in hydrogen fuel cells. In these cells, energy and electricity are produced when oxygen and hydrogen react to form water via oxidation. Oxidation occurs as long as the oxygen and hydrogen are provided. Plus, since the only byproduct is water, fuel cells are a sustainable energy goldmine. However, one obstacle to mass-commercialization of electric vehicles fuel cell is production cost: the cell catalyst, which aids oxidation, is made of platinum, an extremely scarce and expensive material. </p>

			<p> OBJECTIVES. If the oxidation reaction is catalyzed by exposure to platinum, then more exposed surfaces per crystal would result in greater rates of reactions, which leads to more energy. More exposed surfaces per crystal mean less platinum used, which reduces production costs. Regarding biomimetics, since peptides are so important in microscopically shaping biological structures, then perhaps they will be integral in shaping non-biological structures – in this case, platinum nanowires. </p>

			<p> PROCEDURES. To form the nanocrystals, chloroplatinic acid, the peptide BP7A and the reducing agents ascorbic acid and sodium borohydride were combined. The chloroplatinic acid contains platinum ions, the nanowire’s building blocks, while the reducing agents aid the peptides’ adherence to the platinum ions. The peptide BP7A was purified via High Presssure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). </p>

			<p> CONCLUSION. Numerous trials determined peptide BP7A capable of shaping Pt nanowires. Peptide concentration has proven critical in controlling nanocrystal morphology: too much peptide results in overgrowth; too little results in undergrowth. Unfortnately, cyclic voltammetry and polarization tests indicate the synthesized platinum is not as efficient as commercial platinum. It’s conjectured that the peptides were adhering to the nanocrystal surfaces and blocking the oxidation reaction from occurring; future efforts will be directed to developing a procedure for removing the peptides from the crystals’ surfaces. </p>

			<p> ABSTRACT. This research seeks to determine whether biomimetics, a study that incorporates nature’s processes, is a viable technique for shaping nanocrystals. Studying the natural world not only solves numerous engineering problems, such as human-controlled flight, but also provides us new ways of viewing and valuing nature, opening the door to innovation. We have explored the option of using BP7A (TLHVSSY) peptides, obtaining them through phage display technique. We then synthesize twin-structure 1.74 ± 0.53 nm diameter nanowires, reducing a H2PtCl6 (Chloroplatinic (IV) Acid) precursor with ascorbic acid and sodium borohydride in the presence of the peptide BP7A in an aqueous solution. Obtaining the nanowires, we synthesized, characterized, and tested the electrochemical performance of Pt nanowires in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and compare our samples to the conventional commercial Pt nanoparticle catalyst. We have shown that peptides can influence the shape of nanocrystals, which in turn results in different catalytic activity. However, our Pt nanowires are not as efficient as commercial Pt. </p>
