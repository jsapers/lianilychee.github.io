			TITLE <br> <br>

			<p> Throughout my four years in high school, I have played the role of rookie, leader, and mentor in my school robotics team, <a href="http://www.camsrobotics.org" target="_blank" class="folioLink">The NerdHerd</a>. Twenty-five percent of the student body participates in the NerdHerd. I started by competing in the VEX Robotics branch of the team and progressed to the FIRST Robotics Competition by sophomore year. </p>

			<p> The FIRST Robotics Competition is an intense, six-week program in which students design, manfacture, assemble, program, and implement a 120-pound robot fitting the year's game. I was selected to be one three Mechanical Leaders during my junior year, responsible for spearheading designing the robot's drive system. The main objective of the 2012 Challenge, Rebound Rumble, was to score foam basketballs into goals of varying heights and point values. </p>

			<p> Additionally, I managed the team in-house manufacturing effort: training members on how to use the computer-aided manufacturing software, MasterCAM X4, how to operate the HAAS CNC Mills and Lathes, then coordinating and delegating the computer-aided manufacturing and machining tasks. Consequently, the 2012 robot, Lucky Ted, was the first robot in the ten-year team history to comprise entirely of in-house fabricated parts. </p>
